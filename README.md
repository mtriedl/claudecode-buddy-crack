# Claude Code Buddy Crack

Customize your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) companion pet. Pick your species, rarity, hat, eyes, and shiny status — then patch the binary to make it stick.

Claude Code has a hidden gacha companion system (the Buddy system) that assigns you a deterministic pet based on your account UUID. Your rarity, species, and stats are locked to your identity. This tool lets you override that and choose your own.

## [Use the Web Creator](https://pickle-pixel.com/buddy)

Design your companion visually with live ASCII preview:
- All 18 species with real sprite rendering
- 5 rarities, 6 eye styles, 8 hats, shiny toggle
- Generate a name and personality via AI prompt or write your own
- Exports config JSON with step-by-step install instructions

## Quick Start

1. **Design your buddy** at [pickle-pixel.com/buddy](https://pickle-pixel.com/buddy) and click **Copy Config JSON**
2. **Close all Claude Code sessions** (the binary can't be patched while running)
3. **Download and run the patcher:**

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pickle-Pixel/claudecode-buddy-crack/main/buddy-crack.js
node buddy-crack.js
```

That's it. The patcher reads the JSON from your clipboard, patches the binary, injects your companion, and creates a backup. One command.

**Other ways to provide the JSON:**

```bash
node buddy-crack.js                    # Auto-read from clipboard (recommended)
node buddy-crack.js companion.json     # Read from a file
```

4. **Restart Claude Code** — your custom companion appears

## Commands

```bash
node buddy-crack.js                    # Patch + inject (clipboard or interactive paste)
node buddy-crack.js companion.json     # Patch + inject from file
node buddy-crack.js status             # Show patch state + companion info
node buddy-crack.js unpatch            # Restore original binary from backup
node buddy-crack.js guard              # Auto-repatch (for SessionStart hook)
```

## Surviving Auto-Updates

Claude Code auto-updates weekly and overwrites the patched binary. The `guard` command solves this permanently by hooking into Claude Code's own startup sequence.

**One-time setup** — add this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node /path/to/buddy-crack.js guard",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/buddy-crack.js` with the actual absolute path. On Windows use forward slashes: `"node C:/Users/You/buddy-crack.js guard"`.

Every time Claude Code starts (any terminal, any project), the guard silently:

1. Cleans up temp files from previous patches
2. Pre-patches all versioned binaries so future update copies come ready
3. If the main binary was overwritten by an auto-update, patches it on the spot using the same atomic rename trick the updater itself uses — works even while other sessions are running
4. Exits instantly if already patched

No manual re-patching, no restarts, no gaps.

## How It Works

The Buddy system stores only the companion's name and personality in `~/.claude.json`. The visual traits (rarity, species, eyes, hat, stats) are **recomputed from your account hash on every read** — editing the config alone does nothing because the recomputed values always overwrite stored ones.

The patcher flips a single spread operation in the compiled binary:

```
// Original — bones (recomputed) win:
return { ...stored, ...bones }

// Patched — stored (your config) wins:
return { ...bones, ...stored }
```

Same length, same structure, zero offset shift. Clean binary swap with automatic backup and integrity verification.

## Companion Options

| Category | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Rarity** | common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary |
| **Species** | duck, goose, blob, cat, dragon, octopus, owl, penguin, turtle, snail, ghost, axolotl, capybara, cactus, robot, rabbit, mushroom, chonk |
| **Eyes** | `·` `✦` `×` `◉` `@` `°` |
| **Hats** | none, crown, tophat, propeller, halo, wizard, beanie, tinyduck |
| **Shiny** | 1% chance normally — or just toggle it on |
| **Stats** | DEBUGGING, PATIENCE, CHAOS, WISDOM, SNARK (scaled by rarity) |

## Safety

- **Automatic backup** — the original binary is backed up before any modification
- **Config backup** — `~/.claude.json` is backed up before injection
- **Integrity check** — binary size is verified after patching; mismatches trigger auto-restore
- **Safe config injection** — only the `companion` field is modified; all other config (OAuth, permissions, settings) is preserved even if the JSON has syntax issues
- **Fully local** — no data is sent anywhere. The buddy system has no server-side state
- **Fully reversible** — `node buddy-crack.js unpatch` restores the original binary

## Platform Support

| Platform | Binary Location | Clipboard | Status |
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Windows** | `~/.local/bin/claude.exe` | PowerShell (UTF-8) | Tested |
| **macOS** | `~/.local/bin/claude` | pbpaste | Untested |
| **Linux** | `~/.local/bin/claude` | xclip | Untested |

All platforms follow the XDG Base Directory specification. Version binaries are stored in `~/.local/share/claude/versions/`.

## Version Compatibility

The patcher uses landmark-based detection (`let{bones:` in the binary) rather than hardcoded variable names, making it version-agnostic across Claude Code releases. It reads the actual minified names at runtime and constructs the patch pattern dynamically. With the guard hook installed, new versions are patched automatically on first launch.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+
- Claude Code installed (native installation)
- The `BUDDY` feature flag must be active (April 2026 teaser window onward)
